App::Booklist version 0.5
=========================

    Track books you have read, are reading, or plan to some day read.
    Currently CLI-only but maybe one way we'll grow a web layer.

DESCRIPTION

This module supports a command-line app, booklist, which will generate
a small SQLite database and store various bits of book-related
information in it. It will also generate various descriptive
statistics, so you can easily get a count of the number of books
you've read so far this year, or the number of unfinished books you're
currently reading, or even the total number of pages you've read since
you started keeping track.

Basically, the target audience is OCD-afflicted bibliophiles who think
plain text files are a bit too passe.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


DEPENDENCIES

Many, but they're all Perlish and should be taken care of if you
follow the usual steps.
